# Box-Stream

Rust bindings to [box-stream-c](https://github.com/AljoschaMeyer/box-stream-c).

### Documentation

TODO host docs at github pages and link to them
TODO add examples directory and include interoperability examples with the js implementation.

### Building

This module depends on [libsodium](https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium).

This also contains [box-stream-c](https://github.com/AljoschaMeyer/box-stream-c) as a git submodule, so be sure to perform the right git magic when cloning, updating etc.
